# FEEDBACK PAGE

SPA React application to submit a page feedback form. Once a review is submitted a user can see the statistics graph displaying a number of reviews by its rating. As for validation, I used yup library that nicely works with formik state. Various errors are raised upon invalid data input preventing the form submission.

Technology used:

- React
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Highcharts
- Formik
- Yup
- react-resting-library, jest
